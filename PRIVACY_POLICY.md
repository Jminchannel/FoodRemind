*   **Reminder Settings:** Configurations for meal reminders, such as time and enabled status.

### How We Use Your Information

The data stored on your device is used solely to provide and improve the App's core functionality:

*   To personalize your experience (e.g., greeting you with your nickname).
*   To manage your custom list of food choices.
*   To keep a history of your meals for your reference.
*   To schedule and trigger local notifications for meal reminders as you have configured them.

### Data Sharing and Disclosure

### Device Permissions

To provide reminder functionality, the App may request the following permissions:

*   **Notifications:** To display reminder alerts at the times you set.
*   **Set exact alarms:** To ensure reminders are triggered accurately and on time, even when the App is not running.
